Summary of the findings:

There are 29 gender types identified by the respondents, where more than 97% of the respondents identified themselves as either Males or Females. If we focus on them, 92.4% identified as males and 7.6% as females.

There are significant differences in the number of unanswered questions between female and male respondents, including StackOverFlow and place of work related questions.

There many more males than females with 7 and 8 ratings but less with 3,4,5 ratings. Also males edged females in 10 rating. Overall it seems that the male respondents are slightly more satisfied in average than female (average 7 for males vs 6.93 for females)

There is immaterial difference in salary size distribution between female and male respondents
